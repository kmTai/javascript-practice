        <p>
          Closure is the concept of function + lexical scope. <br />
          The state(both variable and lexical scope) inside a function will be
          preserved when it is declared, <br />
          and being keep alive to observe or make updates to these variables
          over time.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
              const score = () => {
                let point = 100;//variable in outer scope are considered "private".
        
                return () => {
                  return point++;//scope chain is maintained, 
                };
              };
        
              //"point" is like a private variable belong to its instance
              //tommy has his own state of "point".
              //sally has her own state of "point".
              const tommy = score(); //point = 100, closure is created and saved to the heap. 
              const sally = score(); //point = 100, closure is created and saved to the heap. 
        
              console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 100
        
              console.log("sally:" + sally());//sally's point = 100
              console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 101
        
              console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 102
              console.log("sally:" + sally());//sally's point = 101

        <p>
          P.S.<br />
          Closure let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a
          function that operates on that data, and enable data privacy<br />
          It consumes more memory, because the state is saved in the heap.
